# Ecommerce Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world **data engineering pipeline** for an e-commerce company.  
The goal is to ingest raw data from [fakeapi.net](https://fakeapi.net), transform it into analytics-ready tables, orchestrate the workflow, and visualize business KPIs such as the daily revenue trends, top-selling products and customer segments (new vs returning customers).

It demonstrates how modern data engineering tools work together:
- **Airflow** → Orchestration & scheduling
- **Python** → Data ingestion from API
- **Postgres** → Storage layer
- **dbt** → Transformations & data modeling
- **Docker** → Containerization & reproducibility
- **Apache Superset** → Visualization & dashboards
